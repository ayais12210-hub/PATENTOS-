# PATENT**OS** v2.4

> **Autonomous IP Intelligence & Freedom-to-Operate Agent**

PatentOS is a high-performance, autonomous agentic interface designed to identify "Blue Ocean" intellectual property opportunities. Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, it scans global patent indices to find expired assets, territorial gaps (US-only patents), and replicable technologies for the UK market.

### ⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER (READ CAREFULLY)
**PatentOS is a technical research tool, NOT a legal advisor.**
*   All "Risk Scores," "Replicability Indices," and "Prior Art Simulations" are automated AI assessments.
*   This tool utilizes probabilistic language models which may hallucinate facts or citations.
*   **DO NOT** make commercial or legal decisions based solely on this data. Always consult a qualified Patent Attorney.

### ⚡ Key Capabilities
*   **Neural Search Core:** Identifies semantic overlaps in abstract claims.
*   **Territorial Gap Analysis:** Highlights US patents with no active UK/EU counterparts.
*   **Prior Art Simulation:** Generates potential citation vectors for invalidity attacks.
*   **Design-Around Strategy:** Suggests engineering pivots to avoid infringement.
